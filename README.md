**Description**

If the result is "normal," it means that the app did not detect any signs of pneumonia in the image. However, it is important to note that a negative result does not guarantee that you do not have pneumonia. If you are experiencing any symptoms of pneumonia, such as a cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, you should see a doctor even if the app says you have a normal X-ray.

If the result is "pneumonia," it is important to see a doctor right away. Pneumonia can be a serious condition, and it is important to get treatment early.

This app is not intended to be a substitute for medical advice. If you are experiencing any symptoms of pneumonia, you should see a doctor.
